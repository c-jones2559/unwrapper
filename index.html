    <h1>Unwrapper</h1>
    <h2>hi! this isn't done yet.</h2>
    <p>
        You may be thinking <i>What's this?</i> or <i>Why has Chris sent me this?</i> or <i>Can't I just use Spotify Wrapped or Stats for Spotify?</i> <br>
        Well the answer is no! <br>
        Wrapped is limited in what data it shows you, and you also can't rewatch previous years; it's very rigid. <br>
        Stats for Spotify and other sites use the Spotify API which doesn't have all your data, only bits of it. <br>
        This site uses your raw data from Spotify to give you info about ALL your data from ALL time! <br>
        The only condition is that you have to wait a few days to use it. <br>
        Start by downloading your Extended Streaming History from <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/">this site</a>. <br>
        It says this may take up to 30 days, but it only took 2 for me and I have over 5 years of listening data. <br>
        Once Spotify emails you your data, put the .json files in the field below and you're sorted! <br>
        All data processing is done client-side which means it all happens on your computer and I never see it, making it super secure! <br>
        I hope you enjoy using my service!
